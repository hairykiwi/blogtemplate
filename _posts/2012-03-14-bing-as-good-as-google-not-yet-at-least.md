It looks as though Bing still need to sort out their indexing.

Davebeer.com isn't a very mature site, but you'd expect a little bit of indexing from Bing after a few months of posts. But no, all Bing had were some old links from back when I was playing with Wordpress as a blog engine (before deciding to [host this blog using Githug pages](http://davebeer.com/posts/my-first-post/))

Bing either is very slow at crawling, or it's update rate is incredibly slow. So I fired up <a href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster/"> rel="nofollow">Bing's webmaster tools</a>, validated my site (by a simple upload of an bingsiteauth.xml file) then submitted my sitemap url.

Now it's just a matter of waiting. Four hours later the sitemap is still listed as pending. So I guess I just have to be patient. There isn't much else I can do for the next day or two at least.

But this does make me wonder if more people are using Bing, but it's poor organic search rating is mostly down to it's indexing? I'm not sure, but on the few sites I've been doing SEO/SEM work on, the older more established sites are still well indexed by Bing. It's just the new (< 6 months) sites that have a poor showing. Google's Caffiene still kicks arse as far as freshness goes.
