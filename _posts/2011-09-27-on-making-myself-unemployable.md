title: On making myself unemployable
---

I'm nearing the end of my contract with a client and am considering what to do next. The team I work with is amazing, but I'm unenthused by the product and am really looking forward to a new challenge.

One thing I really want to do is design and build an array of heliostats. Heliostats are mirrors that reflect the sun's rays to a collector, allowing you to either heat water, or generate steam (and using that steam, generate electricity).
It's an interesting engineering problem, requiring high-quality machining, software development, mathmatical calculations and a good bit of kiwi ingenuity.

Doing what I love will be better for my soul, but I wonder if I'll make myself unemployable that way. And if that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Only thing to do is give it a go. And who knows, I may rediscover my love for software development along the way...
